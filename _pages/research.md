### "Customer capital and firm innovation" (JMP)
This paper studies the interaction between customer capital and firm innovation. I develop a step-by-step innovation model where households form deep habits in consumption. These habits act as customer capital for firms: they can increase sales today, at a loss to current profits, to enjoy higher and more inelastic demand in the future. By changing future demand, customer capital affects firms' incentive to innovate. From data on public US firms, I find evidence of demand side effects. When a sector's outputs are consumed more by old households - those with stronger habits, the most productive firms in the sector increase their R&D investment relative to the others. I apply the model to quantify the effects of changes in aggregate customer capital arising from aging demographics. Under the model, the composition shift towards old households over the 1980-2019 period could account for over a quarter of the observed trends in increasing revenue productivity dispersion between firms, increasing concentration, and increasing aggregate markups. The model also shows how customer capital affects the outcomes of innovation policies. With customer capital, innovation subsidies have significantly larger impacts on concentration and markups, around three times as much as an environment without.
